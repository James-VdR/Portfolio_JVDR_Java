//H2
// Println is make text that puts an enter at the end.
// print just makes text without a space/enter.
// size(X,Y); Sets size of app window.
// Text("text",X,Y,); puts text in the application window.
//Fill(R,G,B); put before text to give color depending on what RGB you chose.
//Background (RGB); sets bg color.

//H3
//Stroke(R,G,B); sets color of line.
//StrokeWeight(0); sets thickness of line.
//Line(X,Y, X2, Y2,); the last 2 are rotations.
//Rect(X,Y,W,H); makes a rectangle, location, Width,Height.
//Rect(X,Y,W,H,Corner,Corner,Corner,Corner); Makes a Rectange with smooth corners.
//noFill(); makes it so that the object doesnt get colored in.
//Ellipse(X,Y,W,H); draws a circle L,W,H.
//Arc uses a ellipse (X,Y,W,H, radians(Degrees), radians(Degrees),)); make pie charts.

//H4
//int name = Number; sets a whole number like 1 or 2 for a specific name.
//float name = Number; sets a number with a decimal. so 1.1 or 1.3, to a specific name.
//boolean name = true or false, simple use to give a name a true or false statement.

// - is deduct, 
//+ is Add,
//% is moduling , moduling is like dividing 10 by 3 and how much remains after dividing thus 1 10/3 = 9 thus 1 remains.
//* is multiply and / is dividing.

// ++ is add 1 and -- is remove 1.
// Variable += Number is add to variable.
// Variable -= Number is remove from variable.
// Variable /= number is divide from variable.

// Math.round,  Rounds to closest number.
// Math.ceil, rounds upwards always.
// Math.floor, rounds downwards always.

//H5
//String is a line of text that you can use to print.
//String a="I like birds";
//String b="they are so fun";
//String c="they fly all day";
//String d="onto my dinner tray.";
//println(a+" "+b+" "+c+" "+d);
//a+" "+ adds a space between the texts. and adds the text together.
//STR is a way to convert primitive data types to a string. ?????

//H6
//if statements are a way for code to check if a condition is true and then if true run the code line that comes after it.
//else statement comes after if it means that when "if" is not true it will run the code from the else statement.
//else if is like else but more specific this allows you to run multiple tries insearch for the awnser.
// || is or
// && is and
